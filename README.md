IBM Z AIOps Virtual Hands-on Lab powered by Watson Machine Learning
This is a hands-on lab guide which provides an overview of IBM Z Operational Analytics powered by Watson Machine Learning to help  detect, decide and act to prevent system outages. You will explore the DB2 key performance metrics and see how the Machine Learning feature can auto-learn patterns and build a normal baseline, and compare current performence metrics against the trained model for proactive warnings if anomaly is detected.
